                I love working with talented artists and singers and this is my favourite way to write new songs.

                Itâ€™s all about getting together and creating something greater than your individual ideas, and as a creative I live for those special moments during a co-write when you are onto a great idea or an addictive melody.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                As part of that creative process I can also help you identify your signature strengths and writing styles, and provide some creative direction.
